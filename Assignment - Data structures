5 different subjects out of 100 are given below. Help Analytics Vidhya to find out
the answers of the following questions.
● 🙇 Who scored the highest marks in the subject B?
● 🙇 What is the average marks scored in the subject C?
● 🙇 Who scored the highest percentage of marks?
● 🙇 If considered only top-4 subjects of a candidate, then who scored the highest
percentage of marks?
